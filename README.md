## What is Remedi?

  Remedi is an innovative iOS application to help prevent millions of deaths due to the usage of counterfeit medication. Our application hosts a variety of additional features, allowing the user to track their medications, find reliable pharmacies near them, and alert their doctors if they are taking medications that could interact. 
  
  By adding QR codes to each medication label, users can track any medication through our app. By connecting our app to a live database of all of these medications, we can then monitor their status, and tell users if their scanned medication is authentic.
  
  The other features, such as allowing users to track their medications, are also based off of the QR codes. This allows them to schedule their medications on a weekly basis, allowing them to keep tabs on when they have to take their medications. It also registers a notification, to be sent at that time of day to remind the user to take their medication.
  
  Additionally, by utilizing machine learning, through a support vector machine, we are able to determine the reliability of the nearby pharmacies, and help the user find legitimate vendors.
  
  To ensure our application would run flawlessly, we decided to keep our user interface clear and to the point by incorporating intuitive design and colorful animations. 
  
  To develop and train our support vector machine we used python, and to bring our iOS application to life we used Xcode and Firebase, a secure backend database hosted by google.
